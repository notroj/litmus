## Usage

litmus comprises of a set of test suites as separate executables: each
program takes a URL on the command-line, optionally followed by
username and password.  To run all the suites from a built litmus
tree, use

~~~
 $ make URL=http://dav.example.com/path/ check
~~~

Where http://dav.example.com/path/ is a DAV-enabled collection.  litmus
must be able to create a new collection called 'litmus' at that
location.  The Makefile variable 'CREDS' can also be defined to be a
username/password separated by strings.  e.g. if you have a user 'jim'
defined with password '2518', use:

~~~
 $ make URL=http://dav.example.com/path/ CREDS="jim 2518" check
~~~

To aid debugging, litmus adds a header `X-Litmus-One' to every request
made.  After running a test suite, the file 'debug.log' includes a
full neon debugging trace (unless neon or litmus was configured
without debugging enabled!).

To use after installation is complete ('make install'), run the
'litmus' script, passing in a URL, optionally followed by the
username/password.  For instance:

~~~
 $ litmus http://dav.example.com/path/
~~~

or

~~~
 $ litmus http://dav.example.com/path/ jim 2518
~~~
